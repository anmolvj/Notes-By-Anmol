## KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE BOOK

**QUOTES** ‚ùù

> *"Paper has more patience than people."* - **Anne Frank**



**LEARNINGS ‚úçÔ∏è**

* **Stillness helps us resist the passions of the mob**. It's the key that unlocks insights of genius and allows us to understand them.
* Emptiness is the fast of the mind.
* Quietness without loneliness.
* Find confidence, avoid ego. Confidence comes from knowing that you have overcome worst situations than what is in front of you.
* Don't feed delusions of grandeur, it's an obstacle to stillness. Be confident, you have earned it.
* How much lighter will our baggage be if we are not adding at the top?
* **Of the 7 deadly sins, only envy is no fun at all.**
* Others may hate you but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them and then you destroy yourself.
* Never hesitate in front of a canvas.
* **The body keeps our score.**
* Time is your life, flesh, and blood that you can never get back. So be wary of where you give it.
* **Order the surroundings to match the order you seek in your head.**
* The gentleman makes things his servants. The petty man is servant to things.
* **Solitude** - Sometimes you have to disconnect to better connect with yourself and with the people you serve and love.
* Solitude is the school of genius and the crowded busy world is the purgatory of the idiot.
* Solitude without purpose is a killer of creativity.
* **Sleep** - Abusing the body leads the mind to abuse itself.
* Leisure is **not the absence of activity**, it is the activity. **What is absent is any external justification**. You can't do leisure for pay. You can't do it to impress people. You have to do it for you.
* When we take something relaxing (leisure) and turn it into a compulsion (escape) it's not leisure because we are no longer choosing it. There is no Stillness in that.

**QUESTIONS TO ASK üí¨**

* What will happen to me if I get what I want(desire)? How will I feel after?

**TIPS üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

* Sit still for few minutes and mindlessly watch your thoughts until something starts to materialize.
* Try Stoic Journalling that will force you to reflect for a few minutes every day.
* Have comfort in the existence of helpers like doctors, volunteers, social workers, etc.
