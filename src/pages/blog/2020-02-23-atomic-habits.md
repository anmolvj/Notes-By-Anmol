## Key takeaways from the book:

### Strategies\

* A new habit should not take more than 2 minutes to complete.\
* Habit Stacking -> After \_current habit\_ I will \_new habit\_)\
* Temptation Bundling (Doing what you need to with what you want to)

### Additional Points\

* You binge on something because you think it's gonna make you feel in a better state than how you feel in you current state.\
* Instead of saying "you HAVE to do this" say "you GET to do this". You transition from seeing these behaviors as burden and turn them into opportunities.\
* Prime your environment to make future actions easier\
* Break the habits you wanna make into 2 min phases of habit. Then do just one phase for few days (this way your are casting a vote for your habit).\
* Standardize before you optimize. You cannot improve a habit that doesn't exist.\
* Missing a habit once is accident, missing the habit second time is start of a new bad habit
