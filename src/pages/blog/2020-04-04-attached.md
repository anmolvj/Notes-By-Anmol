### Key takeaways from the book

##### Attachment Styles based on Attachment Theory - `Secure`, `Insecure` & `Avoidant`.

***QUOTES ❝***

> All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love. - **Baruch Spinoza**



**RULE OF THUMB 👍**

* Don’t lose sight of the fact that your attachment needs are legitimate. You shouldn’t feel bad from depending on the person you are closest to. It is part of your genetic makeup.
* Don't rely on one symptom for various signs. It is the whole picture that tells the story.
* Listen for what he/she is NOT saying or doing. He or she may say right things at times but his or her actions tell a different story. People's response to effective communication is always very telling. It either allows you to avoid getting involved in a dead-end relationship OR it helps bring the relationship to a deeper level.
* It's important to remember that even with effective communication some problems won't be solved immediately. What's vital is your partner's response whether he/she is concerned about your well-being, has your best interest in mind and is willing to work on things. This is also a green light when considering going forward with a relationship with someone new.
* Don't expect your partner to know what you are thinking. If you haven't told him/her what's on your mind, she/he doesn't know.
* If however your partner tries to evade important topics, acts defensively or makes you feel foolish or needy, you should heed it as a SERIOUS warning sign.
* Secures, you can turn into an insecure 😟

### AVOIDANTS

**Observations 👀**

* Avoidant's don't date each other.
* When you meet someone new, the probability of them having avoidant attachment style is high, much higher than their relative size in the population.
* Not only are the avoidant recycled back into the dating pool quickly but they are not dating one another, at-least not for long.
* **They see the worm instead of the Apple.**

**Smoking Guns 🧨**

* Sends Mixed messages about his/her feelings towards you or about his/her commitment to you.
* Longs for an ideal relationship but gives subtle hints that it would not be with you.
* Desperate wants to meet the ONE but somehow always finds some fault in the other person or in the circumstances that makes commitment impossible.
* Disregards your emotional well-being and when confronted continues to disregard it.
* Suggests that you are too needy, sensitive or over reacting thus invalidating your feelings and making you second guess yourself.
* Your messages don't get across. Despite your best efforts to communicate your needs he/she doesn't seem to get the message or else ignores it.

**Tips 💁‍♂️**

* If you are avoidant, the first step is to acknowledge your need for space whether emotional or physical when things get too close and then learn how to communicate that need. Explain to your partner in advance that you need some time alone when you feel things getting too mushy and that it's not a problem with him or her but rather your own need in any relationship. This should quell their worries and somewhat calm their attachment systems.



### SECURES

**Observations 👀**

* Not preoccupied with Relationships
* Not fearing remaining alone and never finding someone despite disappointments.
* Doesn't embellish romantic history.
* Comes forth clean and lays all cards on the table.
* Expressing feelings early on is typically a secure trait.
* Acts in a genuine manner.
* People with secure attachment style are less likely to play games. Game playing is a deal breaker.
* Secure people do not have too many negative feelings about the partners with whom a relationship didn't work out.
* If a partner treats a secure person disrespectfully, it's indicative of the partner’s inability to be responsive in a relationship and not of their own worth.
* Incase of doubts, one of the tools most frequently used by people with a secure attachment style is effective communication. They simply surface their feelings and see how their date reacts. If their partner shows true concern for their well being and a willingness to find a middle ground they'll give the relationship a chance. If not they won't stick around to fight for what they believe to be a losing battle.

**Word of Caution 😷**\
*Why people with secure attachment style may stick around for too long in a bad relationship (based on attachment theory)*

* People with secure attachment style view their partners well being as their responsibility. As long as they have a reason to believe their partner is in some sort of trouble they will continue to back him/her. People with secure attachment style are more likely to forgive their partners for their wrong doing.
* The good news is that people with a secure attachment style have a healthy instinct and usually catch on very early that someone is not cut out to be their partner. The bad news is that on occasion when secure people do enter into a negative relationship they might not know when to call it quits. Especially if it is a long term committed relationship in which they feel responsible for their partners happiness.

**Tips** 💁‍♂️

* Just because secure people can get along with anyone, doesn't mean you have to. If you are unhappy after having tried every way to make things work, chances are you should move on. It's in your best interest to end a dysfunctional relationship rather than get stuck forever with the wrong person just because you are secure.
* It is better to find a way to heal the wounds and maintain hope that there are other people out there who share your need for intimacy and closeness. You can be happy again.
* Research on attachment repeatedly shows that when you need for intimacy is met and reciprocated by your partner your satisfaction level will rise.
* Incongruent intimacy needs on the other hand usually translate into substantially lower satisfaction.
