👨‍💻 I am a Software Engineer in California, US. I studies Computer Science & Engineering at Santa Clara University and graduated in 2018.
✍️On this website I post tips and ideas I learn about from books and other resources I read and have found helpful over the years.
🤓 I learned to code while I was in college studying Electronics and Telecommunication engineering which later led me to pursue graduate studies in computer science eventually bringing me to United States.
🎞 Among my extra curricular goals for 2020 are completing 50 hours of surfing🏄‍♂️, listening to 26 audio books 📚and participate in my first powerlifting competition 🏋️‍♂️.
