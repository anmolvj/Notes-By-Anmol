## Key takeaways from the book

* Stillness helps us resist the passions of the mob. It's the key that unlocks insights of genius and allows us to understand them.
* Tao is in emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind.
* Have comfort in the existence of helpers - doctors, volunteers, helpers
* Quietness without loneliness.
* Sit still for few minutes and mindlessly watch your thoughts until something starts to materialize.
* Paper has more patience than people.
* Try Stoic Journalling that will force you to reflect for a few minutes every day.
* Find confidence, avoid ego. Confidence comes from knowing that you have overcome worst situations than what is in front of you.
* Don't feed delusions of grandeur, its an obstacle to stillness. Be confident, you have earned it.
* How much lighter will our baggage be if we are not adding at the top?
* Of the 7 deadly sins, only envy is no fun at all.
* What will happen to me if I get what I want(desire)? How will I feel after?
* Others may hate you but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them and then you destroy yourself.
* Never hesitate in front of a canvas.
* The body keeps our score.
* Time is your life, flesh, and blood that you can never get back. So be wary of where you give it.
