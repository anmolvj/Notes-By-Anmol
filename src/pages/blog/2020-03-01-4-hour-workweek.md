REALITY AND TIME

\- “Whenever you find yourself on the side of majority, its time to stop and reflect” -Mark Twain

\- People don't want to be millionaires, they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy.

\- What is the pot of gold that justifies spending best years of your life hoping for happiness in the last.

\- The perfect job for most people is the one that takes least time. To free time and automate income is important.

\- Reality (outside of science and law) is negotiable.





\- Freedom Multiplier:(What you do)\*(when you do it)\* (where you do it)*(with whom you do it)

\- Focus on being productive instead of being busy.

\- "Someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.



\- **Emphasize strengths, don’t fix weaknesses.**Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.



\- Distress is bad, eustress is good: don’t a void stress or criticism. Seek helpful stress/criticism

\- Most people will choose failure over uncertainty.

\- When you are unable to achieve something, its not the driver (you) who has reached it's limit, it's the vehicle (processes) that have.

\- Defining Fear=Conquering fear. Cut through your ambiguous anxiety by defining your worst case scenario and you won’t be so afraid anymore.What we fear doing most is usually what we need the most to do.



* It’s important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction/postponement. (Financial, emotional, physicial)

\- What are you waiting for? If answer is the rejected reason of "good timing", the answer is simple. You are afraid, just like rest of the world.

\- Develop the habit of Action.

\- There is less competition for bigger goals.

* Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides endurance to overcome trials. Realistic goals are uninspiring



\- Opposite of happiness is boredom. Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness.



\- Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.



\- If next stepis to research - get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of searching online or spending time in books which can turn into paralysis by analysis.

\- Best first step is finding someone who has done it and asking advice on doing the same. Setup a meeting, a phone call, etc.







\- Time is wasted in proportion to the amount that is available. Use deadline to achieve goals and stop them from expanding into available time to complete them.

\- Define a todo list and a not to do list.

\- What 20% of the sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness.

\- What 20% of the sources are causing 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness.







\- "Herbert A. Simon":- What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.



\- It is imperative that you learn to ignore or redirect all information or interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant or unactionable.

\- Focus on Just in Time information instead of just in case information.





\- For every task, ask the question - Can I outsource it for Cheap (like Graphic Design for my Website)

\- About Requests: Sentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a second grade reading level

\- Genius is only a super power of seeing.

\- Creation is a better means of self expression than possession. It is through creating not possessing that life is revealed.



\- Credibility Indicators make you being perceived as expert.

\- World wide brands - way to find wholesale manufacturers who are ready drop ship to your customers which allows you to avoid repurchasing inventory.

\- [Shopster.com](http://shopster.com/) has over 1 million drop ship manufactures



\- Make mistakes of Ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things not the strength to suffer.



\- Being able to quit things that don't work is integral to being a winner. Going into a project or job without defining when worthwhile becomes wasteful is like going into a casino withouta cap on what you will gamble. Dangerous and Foolish.
