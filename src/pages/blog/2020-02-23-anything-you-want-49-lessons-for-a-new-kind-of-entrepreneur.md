### Key takeaways from the book

* Don't punish everyone for one person's mistake (don't make rules against your customers due to one bad experience with a customer)
* Proudly exclude people, proudly say what you are not. This will enable you to win the hearts of the people you want.
* Ideas are just a multiplier of execution. The greatest of the idea are zero if not executed. Smallest of the idea have substance if you execute them.
* Start now, no funding needed
* Make messages funny and grandiose ðŸ˜‚ Use your humor.
* It's about being someone, not having something (not outsourcing but enjoying the joy that comes with learning and doing it yourself)
* Delegation Mindset: Teach, document, and make yourself unnecessary to the running of your company
* To be a business owner make sure that if you leave for a year and then come back your business will be in a better position before you left it.
* In your company, you can make your role anything you want it to be. Anything you hate to do someone else loves. So find that person and let him do it.
* Delegate but don't abdicate
