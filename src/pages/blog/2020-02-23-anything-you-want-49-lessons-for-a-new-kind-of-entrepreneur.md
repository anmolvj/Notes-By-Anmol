### Key takeaways

* Don't punish everyone for one person's mistake. Donâ€™t impose rules for on your customers due to one bad experience with another one.
* Proudly exclude people, proudly say what you are not. This will enable you to win the hearts of the people you want.
* The greatest of the idea are zero if not executed. Smallest of the idea have substance if you execute them. **Ideas are just a multiplier of execution.**
* Make all forms of writing funny and grandiose within reason by using your humor.
* It's about being someone, not having something. Do not outsource all tasks but rather enjoy the joy that comes with learning and doing it yourself.
* **Delegation Mindset**: Teach, document, and make yourself unnecessary to the running of your company.
* To be a business owner make sure that if you leave for a year and then come back your business will be in a better position before you left it.
* In your company, you can make your role anything you want it to be. Anything you hate to do someone else loves. So find that person and let him do it.
* **Delegate** but don't **abdicate**.
