## KEY TAKEAWAYS 

### RULE OF THUMB üëç

-   A new habit should not take more than 2 minutes to complete.
-   Habit Stacking - After **current habit** I will perform **new habit**)
-   Temptation Bundling (Doing what you need to with what you want to)

### LEARNINGS ‚úçÔ∏è

-   You binge on something because you think it's gonna make you feel in a better state than how you feel in you current state.
-   Instead of saying "_you HAVE to do this_" say "_you GET to do this_". You transition from seeing these behaviors as burden and turn them into opportunities.
-   Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
-   Break the habits you wanna make into 2 min phases of habit. Then do just one phase for few days (this way your are casting a vote for your habit).
-   Standardize before you optimize. You cannot improve a habit that doesn't exist.
-   Missing a habit once is accident, missing the habit second time is start of a new bad habit.
