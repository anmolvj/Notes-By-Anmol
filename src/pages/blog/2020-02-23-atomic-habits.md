# KEY TAKEAWAYS

**RULE OF THUMB** üëç

* A new habit should not take more than 2 minutes to complete.
* Habit Stacking - After (**current habit**)I will perform (**new habit**)
* Temptation Bundling (Doing what you need to with what you want to) 

**LEARNINGS** ‚úçÔ∏è

* You binge on something because you think it's gonna make you feel in a better state than how you feel in your current state.
* Instead of saying "*you HAVE to do this*" say "*you GET to do this*". You transition from seeing these behaviors as a burden and turn them into opportunities.
* Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
* Break the habits you wanna make into 2 min phases of habit. Then do just one phase for a few days (this way you are casting a vote for your habit).
* Standardize before you optimize. You cannot improve a habit that doesn't exist.
* Missing a habit once is an accident, missing the habit second time is the start of a new bad habit.
